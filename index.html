            <h3 id="headline">Video Game Consoles have been around for 52 years now! It's impressive how long they have been a part of our culture for, and have taken into many shapes and sizes! So today, we are going to discuss the various types of consoles, both home consoles and handheld (Note: This is not 100% accurate, as I do not possess all the information yet, so it's rudimentry. This is a passion project, so I am going to take my time with it.):</h3>
            <ul>
              <!-- <img id="indivdual-console" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/99/Magnavox-Odyssey-Console-Set.jpg" alt="The Magnavox Odyssey"> -->
              <li><strong>1972 (North America), 1974 (Europe)</strong> - The Magnavox Odyssey is the first commercial home video game console. It was created by a small team led by Ralph H. Baer at Sanders Associates. It was capable of displaying three square dots and one line of varying height on the screen in monochrome black and white, with differing behavior for the dots depending on the game played. Due to how early the technology was for the time it was created in, there was no audio the console could generate, and it could not track scores. There was also some stuff The Odyssey console came packaged with, which inlcuded a dice, paper money, and other board game paraphernalia to accompany the games. There was also a peripheral controller, being the first video game light gun, that was sold separately for additional games. The console had a total of 28 games distributed on 11 different game cards for both the US and Europe before production of it discontinued in 1975 due to inflation prices. Before it discontinued, it sold 350,000 units!</li>
              <li><strong>1976 (North America), 1977 (Japan)</strong> - The Fairchild Channel F, short for "Channel Fun", is a home video game console, the first to be based on a microprocessor and to use ROM cartridges (branded 'Videocarts') instead of having games built-in. It was first released by Fairchild Camera and Instrument in November 1976 across North America. There was a second, upgraded version of it that was called the "System II", which had several improvements, including adjustible volumes and removeable controllers. While it was not as well known, it still had the achievement of being one of the first consoles to have game cartridges instead of having games built into it.</li>
              <li><strong>1983 (Japan), 1985 (North America) 1986 (Europe)</strong> - The Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) is a home video game console produced by Nintendo. It was first released in Japan on July 15, 1983, as the Family Computer (Famicom). Amongst all of the consoles during the time period both versions of the console, it was the most popular video game console that helped define a generation, as by 1988, industry observers stated that the NES's popularity had grown so quickly that the market for Nintendo cartridges was larger than that for all home computer software. Wow! Isn't that something!</li>
              <li><strong>1987 (Japan), 1989 (North America/Europe)</strong> - The TurboGrafx-16, also known as the PC Engine outside of North America, is a home video game console designed by Hudson Soft and sold by NEC Home Electronics. With dimensions of just 14 cm × 14 cm × 3.8 cm (5.5 in × 5.5 in × 1.5 in), the Japanese PC Engine is the smallest major home game console ever made, and it was indeed small! In Japan, the PC Engine was very successful, as it gained strong third-party support and eventually became the Super Famicom's main rival. However, the TurboGrafx-16 failed to break into the North American market and was a commercial failure, which has been blamed on the delayed release and inferior marketing (Probably because they lied about it being 16bit.)</li>
              <li><strong>1989 (Japan/North America), 1990 (Europe)</strong> - The Game Boy is a handheld game console developed by Nintendo, being made following the succes of the Game&Watch. It proved to be so highly successful that the Game Boy became a cultural icon of the 1990s and early 2000s. This is especially due to the low price of the handheld console itself, but also the long-lasting battery life, which is 30 hours! Also because of it's surpsingly durable parts, it can handle even explosions, as seen with a Game Boy that was displayed in the New York Nintendo Store, which can still play games!</li>
              <li><strong>1993 (Japan)</strong> - The FM Towns Marty is a home video game console released in 1993 exclusively for the Japanese market. It was based on the earlier FM Towns computer system Fujitsu had released in 1989, and the Marty was backward-compatible with older FM Towns games. Despite having excellent hardware from a gameplay perspective, both the FM Towns and the FM Towns Marty were very poor sellers in Japan, as they were expensive and the custom hardware meant expandability was not as easy as with DOS/V systems, and thus were discontinued in 1995, just two years after it's release.</li>
              <li><strong>1995 (Japan), 1994 (North America)</strong> - The Virtual Boy was essentially the first vr console in history! Honestly, it wasn't the best, as the constant red colors up close would give people headaches.</li>
              <li><strong>1998 (Japan), 1999 (North America/Europe)</strong> - The Dreamcast was the final home video game console manufactured by Sega. Though its Japanese release was beset by supply problems, the Dreamcast had a successful US launch backed by a large marketing campaign. However, sales steadily declined as Sony built anticipation for the PlayStation 2. The Dreamcast's 2001 discontinuation ended Sega's 18 years in the console market.</li>
              <li><strong>2001 (Japan/North America/Europe)</strong> - The Game Boy Advance (GBA) is a 32-bit handheld game console developed, manufactured, and was the successor to the Game Boy Color. It had a large amount of accessories compared to most handheld consoles during and before the generation the GBA was first made, the most popular of them being the Game Boy Advance link cable, especially due to the ability to play multiplayer games on it!</li>
              <li><strong>2005 (Japan/North America/Europe)</strong> - The Xbox 360 is a home video game console developed by Microsoft. As the successor to the original Xbox, it is the second console in the Xbox series. The Xbox 360 is one of the first home consoles (if I remember correctly...) to have online functionality, along with receiving regular updates during the console's lifetime. Available in free and subscription-based varieties, the Xbox Live service allows users to play games online; download games (through Xbox Live Arcade) and game demos; and much more! In addition to online multimedia features, it allows users to stream media from local PCs.</li>
              <li><strong>2004 (Japan/North America) 2005 (Europe)</strong> - The Nintendo DS is a foldable handheld game console produced by Nintendo, The DS, which stabds for "Developers' System" or "Dual Screen", introduced distinctive new features to handheld games: two LCD screens working in tandem (the bottom one being a touchscreen), a built-in microphone, and support for wireless connectivity. The dual screens are encompassed within a clamshell design similar to the Game Boy Advance SP, allowing it to be closed for both storage and saving batteries due to the ability for users to close the Nintendo DS system to trigger its 'sleep' mode, which pauses the game being played and saves battery life by turning off the screens, speakers, and wireless communications; however, closing the system while playing a Game Boy Advance game will not put the Nintendo DS into sleep mode, and the game will continue to run normally. The Nintendo DS also features the ability for multiple DS consoles to directly interact with each other over Wi-Fi within a short range without the need to connect to an existing wireless network. Alternatively, they could interact online using the now-defunct Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection service. The bottom screen can be touched using the stylist stick that comes with the DS, a finger, or anything else to interact with the games played. (Although I would not recommend using something sharp or metal to touch the screen, as despite it being resistive touchscreen, it's still a screen that shouldn't be abused.</li>
              <li><strong>2012 (Japan/North America/Europe)</strong> - The Wii U was a home video game console developed by Nintendo as the successor to the Wii... While it did have some rather interesting things, such as a touchpad controller that came with the console, and it's backwards compatability with the Wii games, it... Unfortunately failed as a console. It was discontinued in 2017, in which the Nintendo Switch came in and became successful!</li>
              <li><strong>2011 (Japan/North America/Europe)</strong> - Before the Wii U was released, Nintendo also made the successor to the Nintendo DS known as the 3DS. It's  most prominent feature of the 3DS is its ability to display stereoscopic 3D images without the use of 3D glasses or additional accessories. Other features of the 3DS include its StreetPass and SpotPass tag modes that were powered by Nintendo Network, augmented reality capabilities using its 3D cameras, and Virtual Console, which provides a method for users to download and play video games originally released for older video game systems. It was one of my most favorite handheld consoles, and I had used it for the longest of time.</li>
              <li><strong>2020 (Japan/North America/Europe)</strong> - The PlayStation 5 (PS5) is a home video game console developed by Sony Interactive Entertainment. The base model includes an optical disc drive compatible with Ultra HD Blu-ray discs. The Digital Edition lacks this drive, as a lower-cost model for buying games only through download. Personally, the standard version is better in my opinion. I also saw online that scalpers bought a bunch of these and sold them for ridiculous prices, which sucks for those who wanted to buy them.</li>
